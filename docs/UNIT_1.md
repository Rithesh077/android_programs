# UNIT 1 — Introduction to Android Application Development

## 1. History of Mobile Applications
Early mobile devices supported only built-in firmware-based applications such as calling, messaging, and basic games. With the introduction of smartphones, mobile applications evolved into user-installable software distributed through centralized app stores.

Android, introduced in 2008, enabled an open-source mobile ecosystem, allowing developers to build applications using standard programming languages and frameworks.

## 2. Mobile App Market Trends
Modern mobile applications emphasize:
- Offline-first functionality
- Hardware integration (camera, sensors, GPS)
- On-device processing
- Privacy-aware design
- Responsive UI for multiple screen sizes

Android dominates the global market by device count due to its open ecosystem and manufacturer flexibility.

## 3. Web Application vs Mobile Application

| Feature           | Web Application | Mobile Application  |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Installation      | Browser-based   | Installed on device |
| Hardware Access   | Limited         | Full access         |
| Offline Support   | Partial         | Strong              |
| Performance       | Moderate        | High                |
| Lifecycle Control | Browser-managed | OS-managed          |

## 4. Mobile Operating Systems
Major mobile operating systems include:
- Android (Linux-based)
- iOS (Darwin-based)
- HarmonyOS
- KaiOS

Android is widely adopted for academic and industry use due to its open-source nature and extensive documentation.

## 5. Introduction to Android
Android is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. It provides an application framework that manages activities, services, resources, and hardware access.

Android applications are lifecycle-driven and resource-managed by the operating system.

## 6. Introduction to Kotlin
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language officially supported by Google for Android development. It improves upon Java by offering:
- Null safety
- Concise syntax
- Functional programming constructs
- Better asynchronous programming support

---

## 7. Kotlin Basics
### Variables
- `val` defines immutable variables
- `var` defines mutable variables

### Functions
Functions encapsulate reusable logic and improve modularity.

## 8. Android Studio
Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development. It provides:
- Code editor
- Android emulator
- Gradle-based build system
- Debugging and profiling tools

---

## 9. First Android Application
A basic Android application consists of:
- Activity class
- XML layout
- AndroidManifest.xml

The first application validates project setup, emulator configuration, and build pipeline.

## 10. Running and Debugging Applications
Applications are tested using:
- Android Emulator
- Logcat logging
- Breakpoints

Debugging helps identify logical and runtime errors.

## 11. Exercises
1. Display Text and Image using TextView and ImageView
2. Implement Functions using Kotlin
